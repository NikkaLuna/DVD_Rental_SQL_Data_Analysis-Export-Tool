**DESCRIPTION:**

As a data analyst who frequently conducts data extractions from a larger database, I created this project to emulate a common process where extracted data is harnessed for in-depth analysis. 

Each data extraction serves various organizational needs, ranging from the creation of executive summaries to the provision of comprehensive, detailed datasets. This project aims to replicate and streamline this process, enabling the development of a repeatable system for data export, import, and analysis. It caters to the diverse needs of stakeholders.

## Key Features

- Seamlessly extracts and analyzes data within a single database, simplifying the technical challenges associated with managing multiple databases.
- Defines a "report" as a comprehensive collection of data aimed at answering real-world business questions.
- Each report is divided into both a detailed section, which contains granular data that provides the necessary information to address the business question, and a summary section, which presents relevant aggregated data that directly answers the business question. This section simplifies decision-making by providing a concise overview of key insights.

## Business Questions

My project's business questions rely on data aggregation, and the summary data is automatically generated from the detailed data.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to provide data analysts with a versatile tool that streamlines the process of data extraction, import, and analysis.
